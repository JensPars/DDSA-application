<div class="introduction"><h2>CV Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a 2nd year MSc student at The Technical University of Denmark, specializing in machine learning and computer vision. I have a strong academic record and practical experience developing innovative computer vision solutions. My recent publication in WACV24, supervised by Prof. Dim P. Papadoupulous, focuses on synthetic data for vehicle damage assessment. I had the pleasure of presenting this work at the D3A synthetic data workshop. I have also presented our work on generative diffusion augmentation for object detection models at the D3A synthetic data workshop. Additionally, I have experience as a teaching assistant for Master's level courses at DTU and 3 years of industry experience developing deep-learning computer vision systems for aseptic manufacturing at Novo Nordisk.</p>
