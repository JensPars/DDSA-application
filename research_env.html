Having studied at DTU for my bachelor's and master's degrees, I have developed an appreciation for the academic and social environment. The Visual Computing Group provides an exceptional collaborative atmosphere where I have built relationships with PhD students and faculty members, mainly through participating in conferences like D3A. These connections have allowed me to engage with state of the art research and develop a network of potential collaborators.
DTU is the ideal environment for my PhD research. My established relationship with Professor Dim Papadopoulos represents a significant advantage; having completed 45 ECTS under his supervision (including IDLCV, DCLV, two research-oriented special courses, and my bachelor thesis), we have developed an effective working relationship and complementary research approaches. This collaboration provides a solid foundation for my proposed project.

The Visual Computing Group at DTU Compute offers excellent resources for my project, including high-performance computing infrastructure, which I am accustomed to using. The group's focus on computer vision and machine learning methodologies aligns with my project proposal.
